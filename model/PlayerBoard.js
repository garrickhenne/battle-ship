// Each ship can be placed either horizontally or vertically on the board, and cannot be placed partially off the board.

// Each tile is denoted by a coordinate, A-J for columns and 1-10 for rows

// i.e. the top left corner would be at coordinate A1
// Each player then takes turns picking a tile on the opposing playerâ€™s grid, taking a shot at that tile.

// If the tile contains a ship, the shot is a HIT
// If the tile does not contain a ship, the shot is a MISS
// A ship is sunk if all the tiles for that ship have been marked as a HIT.

// The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opposing players ships.
